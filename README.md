# revoltapilibrarything

Python wrapper for the revolt api ~~like we didnt already have enough of them~~


## Why make another wrapper?

Because I was bored, and I needed something to turn in as a final project for my programming class


## Features

- Websocket events
- More manual than others, no command processor
- Server fetching
- Role fetching
- Message fetching(not by id)
- Channel fetching
- Member fetching
- Client class wrapping everything else, meaning 1 import only (`import client`)
- Message sending
- Support for both user and bot tokens


## Getting Started

To get started using the API, you have to use `git clone https://github.com/error-404-null-not-found/revoltapilibrarything` and edit the example.py file which shows some of the API's basic functionality.
